WORMWOOD BOARDING SCHOOL
That name haunted me for a very long time. I went there when i was a kid. Had many adventures, mant mysteries that i solved but also many tortures days. 
One of the mysteries that i solved there was:
" Why isnt Mrs Denevire here? Wherever has she gone? " asked Amelia.
" Well who knows," chorsed Duncan and Dunkin, the twins who always spoke together. it was almost as if they shared the sae brain....
To me, Mrs Denevire being gone was very strange. We were quite close actually, she was almost like a sister to mother. They had grew up together and for her to just 'disapear' was just too strange. Mrs Denevire is our horse riding teacher and Wormwood school. She is a good teacher and taught me for the past 2 years.
"Well, maybe she left due to her wrist injury a few days ago, but i doubt that would be the case." i suggested.
The teachers ought to do something i thought. I need to find out why Mrs Den had left without telling us! I ran back into the dark dark school and banged on Ms Smiths door.
"What is it, can you show some respect to your elders?" She snapped.
"Ms, Ms, where is Mrs Denevire? Did something happen?" " No! she left me a note, here." Ms Smith passed me a note.
It was definetely Mrs Den's handwriting:
  
  
  Hello Ms Emmeline Adel Smith,
  Everyone must be worried sick by now, but rest assured, i am fine.
  Let everyone know,especially
  Penelopy, that i just had to go and see the doctor because of
  My wrist injury. Tell them that i will make every
  Effort to come back after my injury has heeled.
  Kind regards,
  Denevire Commonswell.
  
 
Fine, so she is okay. Wait a second! 
"Ms! Ms! read the first letter of every word! Look! H-E-L-P-M-E! Help Me! Thats what it says! HELP ME! Ms, oh you have got to take this into consideration! She could be in trouble!"
"Oh, Penelopy, im sure its just a coincidence!"
