ACHIMA. What a beautiful acronym, but what represents ACHIMA is even more beautiful. Amelia, Chloe, Hannah, Ivanna, Maddison and Avery. These 5 have more than just friendship. They have love, compassion, and adventure.
What happened to them was absolutely unimaginable! It could have happened to anyone, but it just so happened to them. Faith had just brought them together.
It all started on the 1st of September. All the girls were going to school in complitely different states. But something beyond science had happened during lunch with all girls.....
"Hey! Hailey, get over here! So do you want a burger or mac and Cheese?" Asked Avery. 
" Um...... Burger? " Replied Hailey.
"What did you say?"
"BURGER!"
Avery's head was in a mess. It seemed like her head was spinning, her ears were closed, and her nose was blocked...... It all seemed so starnge. Just as if she was in a dream. She closed her eyes tight. What is happening? She thought.
The sound of girls chattering awoke her...... She slowly opened her eyes and looked around. Am I in heaven? She asked herself. It was dark, like she was in the woods of the big bad wolf. She was definitely not in Louisiana. Definitely not. 
"Hey, another one is here! How many do you think will drop from the sky?" Avery heard.
She immediately opened her eyes. Who was that? That did not sound like Hailey at all! There were 5 other girls there. 3 blond, fair skinned, 2 darker haired girls and very tanned. Who were they? And where were we?
"um......Hello. Who are you? Where do you come from? Where are we? I just have so many question! " Asked Avery.
